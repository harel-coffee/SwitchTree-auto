Here are various scripts used for training decision tree and random forests.

- ML.ipynb is jupyter notebook file used to train randomforests.

It will also write the decision trees in .dot files

-  rftop4_v2.py is a python file. It will read the randomforest file saved using pickle tool (see at the end of the notebook) and convert it into P4 rules.  The code may need to be adapted to different number of trees in the trained random forest.
